# EXTERNAL 128k UPGRADE FOR ZX SPECTRUM 16k/48k
Upgrade ZX Spectrum 48k with 128k of RAM and play all the games that you could not play before. Only the sound will stay as before, but you can always buy an extension module for sound (based on AY-3-8912 or AY-3-8910) to make it sound as ZX Spectrum 128k.

In order to make the RAM expansion work, a small modification to your ZX Spectrum 48k is required:

For Issue 2-4, on IC23 (cut and) bend the pin 1 and connect it to pin 14 (+5V). For Issue 5-6 cut the pin 34 (CASL) on ZX8401 and connect it's via (not the pin) to pin 40 (+5V)

With this mod without the RAM expansion, your ZX Spectrum 48k will work as ZX Spectrum 16k.
